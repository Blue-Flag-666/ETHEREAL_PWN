# ETHEREAL_PWN

Simple ethereal hax.
Ethereal made heavy use of VMP's virtualization & mutation but in the end the developer failed to implement it properly.

Compile in Release x64 , Inject that dll & afterwards inject ethereal.dll.

The code is trash and could be improved alot but in the end I don't care - deal with it, it's a goddamn "bypass" ;-)
